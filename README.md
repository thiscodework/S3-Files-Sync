# S3 Image Upload and Edit Web App

This is a web application built using Streamlit, which allows you to upload images to an AWS S3 bucket, perform basic editing operations on the images, and view the uploaded and edited images.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.9 or later installed
- AWS account with S3 access and credentials (access key and secret key)
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/s3-image-app.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd s3-image-app
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```shell
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Configure AWS credentials:

   - Open the AWS IAM console and create an access key and secret key for your user.
   - Configure the AWS CLI with your access key and secret key:

     ```shell
     aws configure
     ```

     Enter your access key, secret key, default region, and output format.

6. Set up AWS S3 bucket:

   - Create an S3 bucket in the desired region using the AWS S3 console.
   - Ensure the bucket has proper permissions to allow uploading and retrieving objects.

## Usage

To run the application locally, execute the following command:

```shell
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit development server, and you can access the application by visiting http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can use Docker to containerize the application:

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```shell
   docker build -t s3-image-app .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```shell
   docker run -p 8501:8501 s3-image-app
   ```

   Access the application by visiting http://localhost:8501 in your web browser.

## Notes

- Make sure to replace the AWS credentials and bucket name in the `app.py` file with your own values.
- The application assumes JPEG images by default. Modify the code as per your requirements for supporting other image formats.
